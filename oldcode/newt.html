      was an American lawyer and statesman who served as the 16th president of
      the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led

    <h2>Mustafa Kemal Ataturk</h2>
    <p>
      Kemal Atatürk[2] (or alternatively written as Kamâl Atatürk,[3] Mustafa
      Kemal Pasha[a] until 1934, commonly referred to as Mustafa Kemal
      Atatürk;[b] c. 1881[c] – 10 November 1938) was a Turkish field marshal,
      revolutionary statesman, author, and the founding father of the Republic
      of Turkey, serving as its first president from 1923 until his death in
      1938. He undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey
      into a secular, industrializing nation.[4][5][6][7] Ideologically a
      secularist and nationalist, his policies and socio-political theories
      became known as Kemalism.[4] Due to his military and political
      accomplishments, Atatürk is regarded as one of the most important
      political leaders of the 20th century.

    <h2>Sardar Patel</h2>
    <p>
      Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel (Gujarati: [ʋəlːəbːʰɑi dʒʰəʋeɾbʰɑi pəʈel];
      pə-TEL; 31 October 1875 – 15 December 1950), endeared as Sardar,[a] was an
      Indian statesman. He is also called the "Unifier of India".[1] The Statue
      of Unity, the world's tallest statue, was dedicated to him on 31 October
      2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.[2] He served as
      the first Deputy Prime Minister of India from 1947 to 1950. He was a
      barrister and a senior leader of the Indian National Congress, who played
      a leading role in the country's struggle for independence, guiding its
      integration into a united, independent nation.[3] He was one of the
      conservative members of the Indian National Congress. In India and
      elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and
      Persian. He acted as the Home Minister during the political integration of
      India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
